# The Monkees | Rock Band

This page was developed as the first milestone project for the Code Institute Fullstack Web Development course. It is meant to showcast the skills learned in the first section of the course - User Centric Frontend Development. 

The webpage is meant to serve as an official website for the band 'The Monkees.' As the overall purpose of this project is educational, I wanted to create a page from scratch without drawing specific design or functionality inspiration from the official website of the band The Monkees or any other pages related to them.

I developed the design for the page based only on the description of the assignment and the audio and image assets available for this project. The assumption was that this would most closely resemble an actual client assignment, in which there won't be any pre-existing websites, and visual designs.
 
The overarching idea was the page would be appealing to both existing fans and page visitors, who are only now discovering the band. The about section is specifically aimed at anyone wanting an introduction or a reminder into the band's history and members. The rest of the page would be for both fans and newcomers, who would like to enjoy the band's music or get a reminder of their most popular albums. My idea was for the website to service as a short and eyecatching portfolio for the band, that would make people contact them and hire them for events.


## Deployed Site 

The deployed version of the page can be seen [here](https://albenakr.github.io/first-project-rock-band/) 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Git
* GitHub.

## UX

The idea behind the overall design of the page was to provide an emersive experience, where each section is a small piece of discovering or re-discovering the band through its history or music. 

I was aiming for simplistic design, which focuses the attention on the key elements, rather than overflooding the page with too much information and imagery. The styling was meant to be clean, straightforward, but also visually memorable.

Additionally, I wanted to create a page, which provides an interactive experience to the user, rather than a simple outlay the information.

To do so, several overarching design decisions were made:

* There is a lot of 'breathing space' between the sections, as well as each element in a given section. 

* There is minimal text and a lot of the functionality is emphasized through icons or transitions. Examples of that would be the music links or the album covers, which reveal the content of the album once clicked.

* The colors across the page were in slight variations of three main colors: grey, light grey and cyan. The colors were chosen to have two neutral ones, emphasizing the content within the sections, and one more bold colour - cyan - which would make the page a bit more memorable with a more unique and characteristic design. The colours are consistent across the different sections, text, buttons, as well as input fields to create a more seemless user experience.

The page was, as expected from any modern web page, designed to be responsive and work equally well on both mobile and larger screens.

## Features

The requirements of the assignment were to showcast the band's career and music, as well as the possibility to be hired for events. The design of the different sections were guided by those requirements, as well as the available music and image files.

The final version of the webpage provides the following sections:
* About section: an overview of the band and its members;
* Music section: where visitors can listen to some of their most famous tracks online;
* Albums section: where visitors can browse through their most popular albums.
* Contact form: to reach out to the band to hire them;
* Footer section linking to their social medial profiles.


One feature, which could be added in the future, but is beyond the scope of this project is make the Contact form fully functional, so that all submissions are actually recorded.


## Tests

The page was tested through continuously trying out all the functionality, as specified in the initial design (wireframes) and the user scenarios. 

User scenarios:

1. User should see the following sections when scrolling down the page in this order: navigation and cover photo of the band, about, music, albums, contact, links to social media.

2. Navigation bar should include links to the sections: About, Music, Albums, Contact.

3. The navigation bar will remain fixed at the top and go down with the user as they scroll down throughout the page.

4. When a user clicks on any of the links in the navigation, they should be automatically redirected to that section.

5. When user clicks on any of the songs in the Music section, it should redirect them to a different tab, where the song will start playing.

6. When a user hovers over the album cover photos, they should become more opaque.

7. When a user clicks on any of the album cover photos, a modal will show them the tracks list.

8. When a user tried to submit the contact form without filling in some of the fields, a message will appear to ask them to fill it in.


Additionally, the page was tested throughout different device sizes available through the developer tools, including Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, 8Plus, X, iPad, iPad Pro and larger screens.


## Credits

The format and style of this page was inspired through the contend and examples shown throughout the User Centric Frontend Development course.

The images and audio files used were from the following [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets)

I've extensively used Bootstrap documentation to create the navbar, as well as the modals in the Albums section.

Additionally, all of the icons for 'Play' or the social networks were taken from FontAwesome.

In order to make the photos in the about section round from rectangular original photos, I have used the method shown in [this article.](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/circular-images-css/)
