# The Monkees | Rock Band

This page was developed as a milestone project for the Code Institute Fullstack Web Development course. 

It is meant to showcast the skills learned in the first section of the course - User Centric Frontend Development.

The webpage is the website for the band 'The Monkees.' It aims to showcast the band and their music and ultimately get them hired to play at events.

My idea was to make the page interesting to both

## Deployed Site 

The deployed version of the page can be seen [here](https://www.google.com) **change link**

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Git
* GitHub.

## UX

The colors across the page were in slight variations of three main colors: grey, light grey and cyan. 

The colours are consistent across the different sections, text, buttons, as well as input fields to create a more seemless user experience.


### Wireframes

## Features

The requirements of the assignment were to showcast the band's career and music, as well as the possibility to be hired for events.

The design of the different sections were guided by those requirements, as well as the available music and image files.

The final version of the webpage provides an About section with an overview of the band for anyone discovering them now. It has a section, where visitors can listen to some of their most famous tracks, and learn more about their most popular albums.

And lastly, the page includes a contact section, so that fans can hire the band for events.

One feature, which could be added in the future, but is beyond the scope of this project is make the Contact form fully functional, so that all submissions are actually recorded.


## Tests

The page was tested through continuously trying out all the functionality, as specified in the initial design (wireframes) and the user scenarios. 

User scenarios:

1. User should see the following sections when scrolling down the page in this order: navigation and cover photo of the band, about, music, albums, contact, links to social media.

2. Navigation bar should include links to the sections: About, Music, Albums, Contact.

3. The navigation bar will remain fixed at the top and go down with the user as they scroll down throughout the page.

4. When a user clicks on any of the links in the navigation, they should be automatically redirected to that section.

5. When user clicks on any of the songs in the Music section, it should redirect them to a different tab, where the song will start playing.

6. When a user hovers over the album cover photos, they should become more opaque.

7. When a user clicks on any of the album cover photos, a modal will show them the tracks list.

8. When a user tried to submit the contact form without filling in some of the fields, a message will appear to ask them to fill it in.


Additionally, the page was tested throughout different device sizes available through the developer tools, including Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, 8Plus, X, iPad, iPad Pro and larger screens.


## Credits

The format and style of this page was inspired through the contend and examples shown throughout the User Centric Frontend Development course.

The images and audio files used were from the following [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets)

I've extensively used Bootstrap documentation to create the navbar, as well as the modals in the Albums section.

Additionally, all of the icons for 'Play' or the social networks were taken from FontAwesome.

In order to make the photos in the about section round from rectangular original photos, I have used the method shown in [this article.](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/circular-images-css/)
